    <p>
      I am a Physics graduand excited to begin a MSc programme in Quantum Science & Technology at Trinity College Dublin. I have a strong interest in quantum information and foundations, and I am currently engaging in a project this summer regarding system broadcast structures which can be seen to underpin quantum Darwinism.
      I’m particularly excited about the potential of quantum computing and the fundamental questions that quantum physics raises about the nature of reality.
